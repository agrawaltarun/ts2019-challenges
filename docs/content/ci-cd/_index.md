### Continuous Integration / Continuous Deploy

Continuous Delivery is the ability to get changes of all types—including new features, configuration changes, bug fixes and experiments—into production, or into the hands of users, safely and quickly in a sustainable way.

The goal is to make deployments—whether of a large-scale distributed system, a complex production environment, an embedded system, or an app—predictable, routine affairs that can be performed on demand.

This is achieved by ensuring code is always in a deployable state, even in the face of teams of thousands of developers making changes on a daily basis. Maintaining this state eliminates the integration, testing and hardening phases that traditionally followed “dev complete”, as well as code freezes.

## Basic
User needs to create a Jenkins job file which is a [groovy](http://groovy-lang.org) script. The remaining steps (integration with git) are simple and one time. We focus here on just the Jenkins file.


1. Create output directory
2. Create a file in the directory and write some text.
    - `cd directory`
    - `touch _TIMESTAMP.txt`
3. Archive the files under the directory created.

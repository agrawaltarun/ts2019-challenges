You are The Star Lord, one of the Guardians of the Adobe Galaxy trying to save the secrets from the Thanos Hackers Collective to ensure secrets do not fall into the trap.

The Guardians keep all the secrets in a Hashicorp Vault server. This "secrets" server has multiple ways to store secrets like key value, cubbyhole, one time secrets and lots more, but somehow this time the Guardians' vault has been captured by Thanos and you discovered that you are locked out.

Now you need to use the backend entries you have created while designing the vault to recover your most valued secrets. You are the only one protecting the fate of the Adobe galaxy.
